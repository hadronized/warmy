# Foreword

Resources are objects that live in a store and can be hot-reloaded – i.e. they can change
without you interacting with them. There are currently two types of resources supported:

  - **Filesystem resources**, which are resources that live on the filesystem and have a real
    representation (i.e. a *file* for short).
  - **Logical resources**, which are resources that are computed and don’t directly require any
    I/O.

Resources are referred to by *keys*. A *key* is a typed index that contains enough information
to uniquely identify a resource living in a store.

This small introduction will give you enough information and examples to get your feet wet with
`warmy`. If you want to know more, feel free to visit the documentation of submodules.

# Loading a resource

*Loading* is the action of getting an object out of a given location. That location is often
your filesystem but it can also be a memory area – mapped files or memory parsing. In `warmy`,
loading is implemented *per-type*: this means you have to implement a trait on a type so that
any object of that type can be loaded. The trait to implement is [`Load`]. We’re interested in
four items:

  - The [`Store`], which holds and caches resources.
  - The [`Key`] type variable, used to tell `warmy` which kind of resource your store knows how
    to represent and what information the key must contain.
  - The [`Load::Error`] associated type, that is the error type used when loading fails.
  - The [`Load::load`] method, which is the method called to load your resource in a given
    store.

## Store

A [`Store`] is responsible for holding and caching resources. Each [`Store`] is associated with a
*root*, which is a path on the filesystem all filesystem resources will come from. You create a
[`Store`] by giving it a [`StoreOpt`], which is used to customize the [`Store`] – if you don’t
need it nor care about it for the moment, just use `Store::default`.

```rust
use warmy::{SimpleKey, Store, StoreOpt};

let res = Store::<(), SimpleKey>::new(StoreOpt::default());

match res {
  Err(e) => {
    eprintln!("unable to create the store: {}", e);
  }

  Ok(store) => ()
}
```

As you can see, the [`Store`] has two type variables. These type variables refer to the types of
*context* you want to use with your resources and the type of keys. For now we’ll use `()` for
the context as we don’t want contexts – but more to come – and the common [`SimpleKey`] type
for keys. Keep on reading.

## The `Key` type variable

The key type must implement [`Key`], which is the class of types recognized as keys by
`warmy`. In theory, you shouldn’t worry about that trait because `warmy` already ships with some
key types.

> If you really want to implement [`Key`], have a look at its documentation for further details.

Keys are a core concept in `warmy` as they are objects that uniquely represent resources –
should they be on a filesystem or in memory. You will refer to your resources with those keys.

### Special case: simple keys

A *simple key* (a.k.a. [`SimpleKey`]) is a key used to express common situations in which you
might have resources from the filesystem and from logical locations. It’s provided for
convenience, so that you don’t have to write that type and implement [`Key`]. In most
situations, it should be enough for you – of course, if you need more details, feel free to
define your own key type.

## The `Load::Error` associated type

This associated type must be set to the type of error your loading implementation might
generate. For instance, if you load something with [serde-json], you might want to set it to
°serde_json::Error`. This way of doing is very common in Rust; you shouldn’t feel uncomfortable
with it.

> On a general note, you should always try to stick to precise and accurate errors types. Avoid
> simple types such as `String` or `u64` and prefer to use detailed, algebraic datatypes.

## The [`Load::load`] method

This is the entry-point method. [`Load::load`] must be implemented in order for `warmy` to know
how to read the resource. Let’s implement it for two types: one that represents a resource on
the filesystem, one computed from memory.

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};
use warmy::{Load, Loaded, SimpleKey, Storage};

// Possible errors that might happen.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Error {
  CannotLoadFromFS,
  CannotLoadFromLogical,
  IOError(io::Error)
}

impl fmt::Display for Error {
  fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
    match *self {
      Error::CannotLoadFromFS => f.write_str("cannot load from file system"),
      Error::CannotLoadFromLogical => f.write_str("cannot load from logical"),
      Error::IOError(ref e) => write!(f, "IO error: {}", e),
    }
  }
}

// The resource we want to take from a file.
struct FromFS(String);

// The resource we want to compute from memory.
struct FromMem(usize);

impl<C> Load<C, SimpleKey> for FromFS {
  type Error = Error;

  fn load(
    key: SimpleKey,
    storage: &mut Storage<C, SimpleKey>,
    _: &mut C
  ) -> Result<Loaded<Self, SimpleKey>, Self::Error> {
    // as we only accept filesystem here, we’ll ensure the key is a filesystem one
    match key {
      SimpleKey::Path(path) => {
        let mut fh = File::open(path).map_err(Error::IOError)?;
        let mut s = String::new();
        fh.read_to_string(&mut s);

        Ok(FromFS(s).into())
      }

      SimpleKey::Logical(_) => Err(Error::CannotLoadFromLogical)
    }
  }
}

impl<C> Load<C, SimpleKey> for FromMem {
  type Error = Error;

  fn load(
    key: SimpleKey,
    storage: &mut Storage<C, SimpleKey>,
    _: &mut C
  ) -> Result<Loaded<Self, SimpleKey>, Self::Error> {
    // ensure we only accept logical resources
    match key {
      SimpleKey::Logical(key) => {
        // this is a bit dummy, but why not?
        Ok(FromMem(key.len()).into())
      }

      SimpleKey::Path(_) => Err(Error::CannotLoadFromFS)
    }
  }
}
```

As you can see here, there’re a few new concepts:

  - [`Loaded`]: A type you have to wrap your object in to express dependencies. Because it
    implements `From<T> for Loaded<T>`, you can use `.into()` to state you don’t have any
    dependencies.
  - [`Storage`]: This is the minimal structure that holds and caches your resources. A [`Store`]
    is actually the *interface structure* you will handle in your client code.

## Express your dependencies with Loaded

An object of type [`Loaded`] gives information to `warmy` about your dependencies. Upon loading –
i.e. your resource is successfully *loaded* – you can tell `warmy` which resources your loaded
resource depends on. This is a bit tricky, though, because a difference is important to make
there.

When you implement [`Load::load`], you are handed a [`Storage`]. You can use that [`Storage`]
to load additional resources and gather them in your resources. When those additional resources
get reloaded, if you directly embed the resources in your object, you will automatically see the
automated resources – that is the whole point of this crate! However, if you don’t express a
*dependency relationship* to those resources, your former resource will not reload – it will
just use automatically-synced resources, but it will not reload itself. This is a bit touchy
but let’s take an example of a typical situation where you might want to use dependencies and
then dependency graphs:

  1. You want to load an object that is represented by aggregation of several values /
     resources.
  2. You choose to use a *logical resource* and guess all the files to load from.
  3. When you implement [`Load::load`], you open several files, load them into memory, compose
     them and finally end up with your object.
  4. You return your object from [`Load::load`] with no dependencies (i.e. you use `.into()` on
     it).

What is going to happen here is that if any file your resource depends on changes, since they
don’t have a proper resource in the store, your object will see nothing. A typical
solution there is to load those files as proper resources and put those keys in the returned
[`Loaded`] object to express that you *depend on the reloading of the objects referred by these
keys*. It’s a bit touchy but you will eventually find yourself in a situation when this
[`Loaded`] thing will help you. You will then use [`Loaded::with_deps`]. See the documentation of
[`Loaded`] for further information.

> Fun fact: logical resources were introduced to solve that problem along with dependency
> graphs.

## Let’s get some things!

When you have implemented [`Load`], you’re set and ready to get (cached) resources. You have
several functions to achieve that goal:

  - [`Store::get`], used to get a resource. This will effectively load it if it’s the first time
    it’s asked. If it’s not, it will use a cached version.
  - [`Store::get_proxied`], a special version of [`Store::get`]. If the initial loading
    (non-cached) fails to load (missing resource, fail to parse, whatever), a *proxy* will be
    used – passed in to [`Store::get_proxied`]. This value is lazy though, so if the loading
    succeeds, that value won’t ever be evaluated.

Let’s focus on [`Store::get`] for this tutorial.

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};
use std::path::Path;
use warmy::{Load, Loaded, SimpleKey, Store, StoreOpt, Storage};

// Possible errors that might happen.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Error {
  CannotLoadFromFS,
  CannotLoadFromLogical,
  IOError(io::Error)
}

impl fmt::Display for Error {
  fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
    match *self {
      Error::CannotLoadFromFS => f.write_str("cannot load from file system"),
      Error::CannotLoadFromLogical => f.write_str("cannot load from logical"),
      Error::IOError(ref e) => write!(f, "IO error: {}", e),
    }
  }
}

// The resource we want to take from a file.
struct FromFS(String);

impl<C> Load<C, SimpleKey> for FromFS {
  type Error = Error;

  fn load(
    key: SimpleKey,
    storage: &mut Storage<C, SimpleKey>,
    _: &mut C
  ) -> Result<Loaded<Self, SimpleKey>, Self::Error> {
    // as we only accept filesystem here, we’ll ensure the key is a filesystem one
    match key {
      SimpleKey::Path(path) => {
        let mut fh = File::open(path).map_err(Error::IOError)?;
        let mut s = String::new();
        fh.read_to_string(&mut s);

        Ok(FromFS(s).into())
      }

      SimpleKey::Logical(_) => Err(Error::CannotLoadFromLogical)
    }
  }
}

fn main() {
  // we don’t need a context, so we’re using this mutable reference to unit
  let ctx = &mut ();
  let mut store: Store<(), SimpleKey> = Store::new(StoreOpt::default()).expect("store creation");

  let my_resource = store.get::<FromFS>(&Path::new("/foo/bar/zoo.json").into(), ctx);

  // …

  // imagine that you’re in an event loop now and the resource has changed
  store.sync(ctx); // synchronize all resources (e.g. my_resource)
}
```

# Reloading a resource

Most of the interesting concept of `warmy` is to enable you to hot-reload resources without
having to re-run your application. This is done via two items:

  - [`Load::reload`], a method called whenever an object must be reloaded.
  - [`Store::sync`], a method to synchronize a [`Store`].

The [`Load::reload`] function is very straight-forward: it’s called when the resource changes.
This situation happens:

  - Either when the resource is on the filesystem (the file changes).
  - Or if it’s a dependent resource of one that has reloaded.

See the documentation of [`Load::reload`] for further details.

# Context inspection

A context is a special value you can access to via a mutable reference when loading or
reloading. If you don’t need any, it’s highly recommended not to use `()` when implementing
`Load<C>` but leave it as type variable so that it compose better – i.e. `impl<C> Load<C>`.

If you’re writing a library and need to have access to a specific value in a context, it’s also
recommended not to set the context type variable to the type of your context directly. If you do
that, no one will be able to use your library because types won’t match – or people will accept
to be restrained to your only types. A typical way to deal with that is by constraining a
type variable. The [`Inspect`] trait was introduced for this very purpose. For
instance:

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::io;
use warmy::{Inspect, Load, Loaded, SimpleKey, Store, StoreOpt, Storage};

// Possible errors that might happen.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Error {
  CannotLoadFromFS,
  CannotLoadFromLogical,
  IOError(io::Error)
}

impl fmt::Display for Error {
  fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
    match *self {
      Error::CannotLoadFromFS => f.write_str("cannot load from file system"),
      Error::CannotLoadFromLogical => f.write_str("cannot load from logical"),
      Error::IOError(ref e) => write!(f, "IO error: {}", e),
    }
  }
}

struct Foo;

struct Ctx {
  nb_res_loaded: usize
}

impl<C> Load<C, SimpleKey> for Foo where Foo: for<'a> Inspect<'a, C, &'a mut Ctx> {
  type Error = Error;

  fn load(
    key: SimpleKey,
    storage: &mut Storage<C, SimpleKey>,
    ctx: &mut C
  ) -> Result<Loaded<Self, SimpleKey>, Self::Error> {
    Self::inspect(ctx).nb_res_loaded += 1; // magic happens here!

    Ok(Foo.into())
  }
}

fn main() {
  use warmy::{Res, Store, StoreOpt};

  let mut store: Store<Ctx, SimpleKey> = Store::new(StoreOpt::default()).unwrap();
  let mut ctx = Ctx { nb_res_loaded: 0 };

  let r: Res<Foo> = store.get(&"test-0".into(), &mut ctx).unwrap();
}
```

In this example, because the context value we want is the same as the [`Store`]’s context, a
universal implementor of [`Inspect`] enables you to directly [`inspect`] the context. However,
if you wanted to inspect it more precisely, like with `&mut usize`, you would need to write an
implementation of [`Inspect`] for your types:

```rust
use std::fmt;
use std::io;
use warmy::{Inspect, Load, Loaded, SimpleKey, Store, StoreOpt, Storage};

// Possible errors that might happen.
#[derive(Debug)]
enum Error {
  CannotLoadFromFS,
  CannotLoadFromLogical,
  IOError(io::Error)
}

impl fmt::Display for Error {
  fn fmt(&self, f: &mut fmt::Formatter) -> Result<(), fmt::Error> {
    match *self {
      Error::CannotLoadFromFS => f.write_str("cannot load from file system"),
      Error::CannotLoadFromLogical => f.write_str("cannot load from logical"),
      Error::IOError(ref e) => write!(f, "IO error: {}", e),
    }
  }
}

struct Foo;

struct Ctx {
  nb_res_loaded: usize
}

// this implementor states how the inspection should occur for Foo when the context has type
// Ctx: by targetting a mutable reference on a usize (i.e. the counter)
impl<'a> Inspect<'a, Ctx, &'a mut usize> for Foo {
  fn inspect(ctx: &mut Ctx) -> &mut usize {
    &mut ctx.nb_res_loaded
  }
}

// notice the usize instead of Ctx here
impl<C> Load<C, SimpleKey> for Foo where Foo: for<'a> Inspect<'a, C, &'a mut usize> {
  type Error = Error;

  fn load(
    key: SimpleKey,
    storage: &mut Storage<C, SimpleKey>,
    ctx: &mut C
  ) -> Result<Loaded<Self, SimpleKey>, Self::Error> {
    *Self::inspect(ctx) += 1; // direct access to the counter

    Ok(Foo.into())
  }
}
```

# Load methods

`warmy` supports load methods. Those are used to specify several ways to load an object of a
given type. By default, [`Load`] is implemented with the *default method* – which is `()`. If
you want more methods, you can set the type parameter to something else when implementing
[`Load`].

You can also find several *methods* centralized in here, but you definitely don’t have to use
them.

## Universal JSON support

The crate supports *universal JSON implementation*. You can use it via the
[`Json`] type.

> Universal JSON support is feature-gated with `"json"`.

Universal JSON can help and make your life and implementations easier. Basically, it means that
any type that implements [`serde::Deserialize`] can be loaded and hot-reloaded by `warmy`
with zero boilerplate from your side, just by asking `warmy` to get the given scarse resource.
This is done with the [`Store::get_by`] or [`Store::get_proxied_by`] methods.

```rust
use serde::Deserialize;
use warmy::{Res, SimpleKey, Store, StoreOpt};
use warmy::json::Json;
use std::thread::sleep;
use std::time::Duration;

#[derive(Debug, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
struct Dog {
  name: String,
  gender: Gender
}

impl Default for Dog {
  fn default() -> Self {
    Dog {
      name: "Norbert".to_owned(),
      gender: Gender::Male
    }
  }
}

#[derive(Clone, Copy, Debug, Deserialize, Eq, PartialEq)]
#[serde(rename_all = "snake_case")]
enum Gender {
  Female,
  Male
}

fn main() {
  let mut store: Store<(), SimpleKey> = Store::new(StoreOpt::default()).unwrap();
  let ctx = &mut ();

  let resource: Result<Res<Dog>, _> = store.get_by(&SimpleKey::from_path("/dog.json"), ctx, Json);

  match resource {
    Ok(dog) => {
      loop {
        store.sync(ctx);

        println!("Dog is {} and is a {:?}", dog.borrow().name, dog.borrow().gender);
        sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));
      }
    }

    Err(e) => eprintln!("{}", e)
  }
}
```

# Resource discovery

Resource discovery is available via a simple mechanism: every time a new resource is available
on the filesystem, a closure of your choice is called. This closure is passed the [`Storage`]
of your [`Store`] along with its associated context, enabling you to insert new resources on
the fly.

This is a bit different than the first option: this enables you to populate the store with
resources you don’t know yet – e.g. a texture is saved in the store’s root and gets
automatically added and reacted to.

The feature is available via the [`StoreOpt`] object you have to create prior to generating a
new [`Store`]. See the [`StoreOpt::set_discovery`] and [`StoreOpt::discovery`] functions for
further details on how to use the resource discovery mechanism.
