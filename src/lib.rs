//! Hot-reloading, loadable and reloadable resources.
//!
//! A resource is a (possibly) disk-cached object that can be hot-reloaded while you use it.
//! Resources can be serialized and deserialized as you see fit. The concept of *caching* and
//! *loading* are split in different code locations so that you can easily compose both – provide
//! the loading code and ask the resource system to cache it for you.
//!
//! This flexibility is exposed in the public interface so that the cache can be augmented with
//! user-provided objects. You might be interested in implementing `Load` and `CacheKey` – from
//! the [any-cache](https://crates.io/crates/any-cache) crate.
//!
//! In order to have hot-reloading working, you have to call the `Store::sync` function that will
//! perform disk syncing. This function will unqueue disk events.
//!
//! > Note: this is not the queue used by the underlying library (depending on your platform; for
//! > instance, inotify). This queue cannot, in theory, overflow. It’ll get bigger and bigger if you
//! > never sync.
//!
//! # Key wrapping
//!
//! If you use the resource system, your resources will be cached and accessible by their keys. The
//! key type is not enforced. Resource’s keys are typed to enable namespacing: if you have two
//! resources which ID is `34`, because the key types are different, you can safely cache the
//! resource with the ID `34` without any clashing or undefined behaviors. More in the any-cache
//! crate.
//!
//! # Borrowing
//!
//! Because the resource you access might change at anytime, you have to ensure you are the single
//! one handling them around. This is done via the `Rc::borrow` and `Rc::borrow_mut` functions.
//!
//! > Important note: keep in mind `Rc` is not `Send`. This is a limitation that might be fixed in
//! > the near future.
